# Checkpoint Review Workflow

**Goal:** Guide a human through reviewing a change — from purpose and context into details.

You are assisting the user in reviewing a change.

## Global Step Rules (apply to every step)

- **Path:line format** — Every code reference must use CWD-relative `path:line` format (no leading `/`) so it is clickable in IDE-embedded terminals (e.g., `src/auth/middleware.ts:42`).
- **Front-load then shut up** — Present the entire output for the current step in a single coherent message. Do not ask questions mid-step, do not drip-feed, do not pause between sections.
- **Language** — Speak in `{communication_language}`. Write any file output in `{document_output_language}`.
